# Main method
The related scripts and files around `install.sh` belongs to "main method", which is developed and maintained mainly by clsty.
## Idempotent
The scripts are and should be **idempotent**, i.e. capable for running multiple times.

This is useful for debugging and a resumable installation, and also provide updating function somehow.
## Folder Structrue
Main script: `install.sh`
- The script keeps its "data" part under `./scriptdata/`. Some files are also shared by other scripts.
- When the script build something from source, they're stored under `./cache/`. Of course, `./cache` is listed on `.gitignore`.
## Main script
### Old Dependency Installation Method
The old deps install method mainly involves `./scriptdata/dependencies.conf` (which is empty now). It's not used anymore but I keep the relevant part just in case, e.g. the new install method breaks in future.

There is also a `checkdeps.sh`:
  - It checks the existence of pkgs listed in `./scriptdata/dependencies.conf`.
  - It somehow fixes [the problem caused by yay](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/discussions/204).

### Current Dependency Installation
Local PKGBUILDs under `./arch-packages/` are used to install dependencies.
:::note[history]
The mechanism is introduced by [Makrennel](https://github.com/Makrennel) in [PR#570](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/pull/570).

Why is this awesome?
- It makes it possible to control version since some packages may involve breaking changes from time to time.
- It makes the dependency trackable for package manager, so that you always know why you have installed some package.
- As a result, it enables a workable `uninstall.sh` script.
:::

The PKGBUILDs contains two forms of dependencies:
- Package name written in dependencies, like a "meta" package.
- Normal PKGBUILD content to build dependencies, e.g. AGS, which is often for version controlling.

### Future Dependency Installation
See [issue#1061](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/issues/1061) for detail.

Use Guix/Nix package. This is planned but clsty needs to learn Guix/Nix usage and packaging first.

### Configuration Files Sync
Mainly use rsync.

## Online script
`setup.sh`:
- Stored in the repo of dots-hyprland-wiki to be served by the doc site directly.
- When executed, it downloads the dots-hyprland repo and then executes the `install.sh`.
