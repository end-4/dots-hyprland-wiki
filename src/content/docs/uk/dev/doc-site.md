This page "documents" this "documentation site" itself.

The repo of this doc site is [here](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland-wiki) and it's open to [contribution](../doc-site-contrib).

# Development

Currently, this project is based on Starlight, which is based on Astro.

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages using a workflow for GitHub Actions.

The workflow is triggered when a push involves changing under following paths:
- `src/`
- `public/`

It can also be triggered manually.

## Run Locally

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

:::tip
If this error occured: `vips/vips8: no such file or directory`, you may install `libvips` manually, e.g. on Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libvips`

:::caution
When running locally, there seems to be a bug that it doesn't apply a proper base url. But it seems okay on GitHub Pages.
Therefore, do NOT easily "fix" a relative link just because a `404` happened locally. Otherwise, while the link for locally hosted site is "fixed", the site on GitHub Pages will be broken.
Similarly, open <http://localhost:4321/dots-hyprland-wiki/en>, NOT <http://localhost:4321/dots-hyprland-wiki> when running locally.

## How to

### Edit/add pages
:::caution
Always prioritize updating the English documents,
so that other languages can be uniformly updated through English translation.
:::

Edit markdown files under `src/content/docs/en/` .
- **Update the value of `lastUpdated` in frontmatter manually,** e.g. `lastUpdated: 2024-02-10`.
- Somehow different to the markdown on GitHub. [Reference](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content).
- After editing, apply notification for other languages about the source file (English) has updated. To achive this, use the script `l10n-notify`, which syntax is:
```bash
./l10n-notify <file1> [file2] ...
```
This script is not perfect yet, but it's robust and idempotent.

### Misc
- Publish HTML files: Put it under `src/pages`.

- Edit sidebar: Edit `astro.config.mjs`.

- Edit theme: Edit `src/styles/custom.css` ([Reference](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/)).

- Edit homepage: Edit `src/content/docs/en/index.mdx`

:::caution
When generating link paths, the uppercase characters inside original markdown filename will be converted to lowercase, and the `.` will be removed. If you still use the original filename as link path, it may result in a `404`.

# History
This doc site started from [dots-hyprland#246](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/issues/246) and was then initialized mainly by [@clsty](https://github.com/clsty) with contents from the README and built-in wiki of [dots-hyprland](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) and the README of [dots-hyprarch](https://github.com/clsty/dots-hyprarch).
