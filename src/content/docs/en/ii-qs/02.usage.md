</details>

## Overview

- Open with `Super` or `Super`+`Tab`
- Drag a window to another workspace to send it there
- Middle-click to close window

## Launcher

- Bundled with the overview. Just start typing.
- Results can include:
  - App search
  - Math result
  - [Prefix: `/`] Launcher actions
  - [Prefix: `;`] Clipboard history
  - [Prefix: `:`] Emojis
  - Additional actions for typed content: run command, perform search

## Bar controls
- Media widget:
  - Middle-click to Play/Pause
  - Right-click for Next track
  - Mouse4/Mouse5 for Prev/Next track
- Brightness: Scroll top-left corner
- Volume: Scroll top-right corner
- Workspaces:
  - Mouse4 to toggle special workspace
  - Right-click to open overview

# Left sidebar

## General controls
- Tab completion in Intelligence and Anime tabs
  - When suggestions show up above the typing area, use up/down arrow keys to select the desired option, then hit Tab to confirm your choice
- Wanna take the assistant with you? To detach the sidebar into a window, hit `Super`+`Alt`+`A`

## AI Chat

- Type `/model` to select a model. Locally installed Ollama models are detected automatically.
- Type `/key` for instructions on how to get an API key for online models
- Currently, Gemini models with tools can edit your shell config. You can, for example, tell it "hide app icons on my workspaces"

## Translator

Handled with the `trans` commandline tool. Not much to say here...

## Anime boorus

- Type `/mode` and see the available providers.
- Type 1 or many tags to see results. Suggestions show up as you type.
- Type a number to select the page of the results to view

# Wallpaper & colors
- To pick a wallpaper, press `Ctrl`+`Super`+`T` and select an image. This will also
  - Change color of the shell, Qt apps, and GTK apps
  - Change the position of the background clock to the least busy region of the image (currently only works well with single monitor systems)

# Workspace Groups

## Navigation & Workspace Management

If 10 workspaces aren't enough for you, you can use the next set of workspaces, up to Hyprland's limit. To start, simply over-scroll the workspace widget on the bar to the right (or use keybinds) to switch to a new group.

Keybinds and shell widgets work seamlessly in the focused workspace group. You don't have to configure anything extra if you don't change the number of workspaces shown on the workspace indicator or the overview.

- **Navigating / moving workspaces within a group**: Standard Hyprland keybinds apply.
  - `Super` + `2` → workspace **12** if you're in workspace **11-20 (group 2)**.
  - `Super` + `Alt` + `3` silently moves focused window → workspace **23** if you're in workspace **21-30 (group 3)**.

- **Navigating between groups**:
  - Consider adding following Hyprland keybinds for jumping to adjacent workspace groups
    ```ini title="~/.config/hypr/custom/keybinds.conf"
    bind = SUPER ALT, Z, workspace, r-10
    bind = SUPER ALT, X, workspace, r+10
    ```
- The **Overview** and **Workspace indicator** adapt seamlessly. The shown content is based on the current workspace group.
  
:::tip
If you wish to modify the keybinds or include [more features](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Dispatchers/) for workspace navigation, use `~/.config/hypr/hyprland/scripts/workspace_action.sh` script, instead of `hyprctl dispatch`. This will determine the current workspace group using the active workspace ID and dispatch to the proper workspace.

## Multi-Monitor Considerations

Consider these strategies for effective multi-monitor management:
- Allocate group 1 (workspaces 1-10) to primary monitor while group 2 (workspaces 11-20) to secondary monitor:
  - On startup, manually move the starting workspace on the secondary monitor into the second group (e.g., workspace 11) using `Super` + `0`, then `Ctrl` + `Super` + `Right`.
  - In effect, this will also create separate overview widget per monitor.
- Use [workspace binding](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Workspace-Rules/#rules) to always place specific workspaces on specific monitors. Get all your monitor names using `hyprctl monitors | grep Monitor`.
  ```ini title="~/.config/custom/general.conf"
  # Bind workspaces 1-10 (group 1) to primary monitor
  workspace = 1, monitor:eDP-1, default:true
  workspace = 2, monitor:eDP-1, default:true
  ...

  # Bind workspaces 11-20 (group 2) to secondary monitor
  workspace = 11, monitor:HDMI-A-1, default:true
  workspace = 12, monitor:HDMI-A-1, default:true
  ...
  ```
- Focus on two workspaces at a time on each monitor and move/swap windows across monitor/groups (using `Super` + `Left/Right/Up/Down` or `Super` + `Shift` + `Left/Right/Up/Down`) as needed.

:::note
Workspace groups are not natively supported by Hyprland or any status bar/widget system. This config achieves this simply by tinkering wth Hyprland dispatchers and the shell config.
