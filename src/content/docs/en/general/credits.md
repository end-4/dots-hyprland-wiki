[^1]: Thanks to [PR#1060](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/pull/1060) and futher work by clsty, it eventually rescued the dots-hyprland project from a nearly broken status as many users can not complete dependency installation due to the failure of installing python dependencies from AUR.
[^2]: These configs provide helpful references. They thanked more people in their repos btw.
